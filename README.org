* Mapcha Website

This is the web interface for Spatial Informatics Group's Image
Analysis Crowdsourcing Platform (Mapcha).

** Usage

To run this web application, you will need:

1) Sun's JDK 1.8+
2) Boot 2.5.5+

Then simply instruct Boot to run the application as follows:

  In development mode:
  $ boot dev

  In production mode:
  $ boot site

Both commands will start a web server running the Mapcha website.
Connect to it by pointing your web browser at http://localhost:8080.

In development mode, connect to the local nrepl server with your IDE
or using boot from the command-line:

  $ boot repl --client

Then run (start-repl) from the Clojure prompt and refresh your browser
to activate a browser-backed ClojureScript repl.
